## How to Run Code Examples

The code examples are organized into folders, each corresponding to a chapter in the book. The code examples are written in Python and can be run using MyBinder, Google Colab, or Docker.

<!-- Follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GwMoV4LOiU) to learn how to run the code examples. -->

### Using MyBinder

The code examples can be run using MyBinder.

### Using Google Colab

The code examples can be run using Google Colab.

<!-- ### Using Docker

The code examples can be run using Docker. There are two Docker [images](https://hub.docker.com/r/giswqs/pygis/tags) available:

A lightweight docker image without Apache Sedona:

```bash
docker pull giswqs/pygis:book
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app/workspace giswqs/pygis:book
```

A docker image with Apache Sedona:

```bash
docker pull giswqs/pygis:sedona
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 7077:7077 -p 8085:8085 -v $(pwd):/app/workspace giswqs/pygis:sedona
``` -->

## Video Tutorials

Complementing the written content, this book is supported by a comprehensive series of video tutorials that walk through key concepts and provide additional examples: <https://tinyurl.com/duckdb-spatial-videos>.

The videos are designed to complement, not replace, the written material. They're particularly helpful for:

- Visual learners who benefit from seeing code being written and executed
- Understanding complex concepts through multiple explanations
- Learning about the development workflow and best practices
- Seeing how to approach problems and debug issues

The playlist is organized to follow the book's structure. You can watch them in order as you progress through the book, or jump to specific topics as needed.

The videos were created in Fall 2023 when I was teaching the [**Spatial Data Management**](https://geog-414.gishub.org) course at the University of Tennessee. Although the course has concluded, the videos remain relevant and can be used as a reference for the book. Additional videos will be added in the future.

## About the Author

Dr. Qiusheng Wu is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography & Sustainability at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also an Amazon Scholar. Dr. Wu’s research focuses on advancing open-source geospatial analytics through cloud computing and GeoAI. He is the creator and maintainer of several widely used open-source Python packages, including [Geemap](https://geemap.org), [Leafmap](https://leafmap.org), [SAMGeo](https://samgeo.gishub.org), and [GeoAI](https://opengeoai.org), which integrate cloud-based geospatial platforms with AI-powered analysis and visualization. Dr. Wu’s work bridges remote sensing, Earth observation, and artificial intelligence to make large-scale geospatial data more accessible, reproducible, and intelligent for researchers, educators, and practitioners worldwide. His open-source projects can be found on GitHub at <https://github.com/opengeos>.
