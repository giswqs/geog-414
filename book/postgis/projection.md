# Projecting Data

**Setting up the conda env:**

```
conda create -n sql python
conda activate sql
conda install ipython-sql sqlalchemy psycopg2 notebook pandas -c conda-forge
```

**Sample dataset:**
- [nyc_data.zip](https://github.com/giswqs/postgis/raw/master/data/nyc_data.zip) (Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/fROzLrjNDrs) to load data into PostGIS)

## Connecting to the database

```{code-cell} ipython3
%load_ext sql
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
host = "localhost"
database = "nyc"
user = os.getenv('SQL_USER')
password = os.getenv('SQL_PASSWORD')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
connection_string = f"postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{database}"
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%sql $connection_string
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT * from nyc_subway_stations LIMIT 5
```

## Checking SRID

The earth is not flat, and there is no simple way of putting it down on
a flat paper map (or computer screen), so people have come up with all
sorts of ingenious solutions, each with pros and cons. Some projections
preserve area, so all objects have a relative size to each other; other
projections preserve angles (conformal) like the Mercator projection;
some projections try to find a good intermediate mix with only little
distortion on several parameters. Common to all projections is that they
transform the (spherical) world onto a flat Cartesian coordinate system,
and which projection to choose depends on how you will be using the
data.

We\'ve already encountered projections when we
[loaded our nyc data](https://postgis.gishub.org/chapters/postgis_intro.html).
(Recall that pesky SRID 26918). Sometimes, however, you need to
transform and re-project between spatial reference systems. PostGIS
includes built-in support for changing the projection of data, using the
`ST_Transform(geometry, srid)`
function. For managing the spatial reference identifiers on geometries,
PostGIS provides the `ST_SRID(geometry)` and `ST_SetSRID(geometry, srid)` functions.

We can confirm the SRID of our data with the `ST_SRID` function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT ST_SRID(geom) FROM nyc_streets LIMIT 1;
```

And what is definition of \"26918\"? As we saw in
[loading data section](https://postgis.gishub.org/chapters/postgis_intro.html),
the definition is contained in the `spatial_ref_sys` table. In fact,
**two** definitions are there. The \"well-known text\"
(`WKT`) definition is in the `srtext`
column, and there is a second definition in \"proj.4\" format in the
`proj4text` column.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT * FROM spatial_ref_sys WHERE srid = 26918
```

In fact, for the internal PostGIS re-projection calculations, it is the
contents of the `proj4text` column that are used. For our 26918
projection, here is the proj.4 text:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT proj4text FROM spatial_ref_sys WHERE srid = 26918
```

In practice, both the `srtext` and the `proj4text` columns are
important: the `srtext` column is used by external programs like
[GeoServer](http://geoserver.org), [QGIS](https://qgis.org), and
[FME](http://www.safe.com/) and others; the `proj4text` column is used
internally.

## Comparing Data

Taken together, a coordinate and an SRID define a location on the globe.
Without an SRID, a coordinate is just an abstract notion. A
\"Cartesian\" coordinate plane is defined as a \"flat\" coordinate
system placed on the surface of Earth. Because PostGIS functions work on
such a plane, comparison operations require that both geometries be
represented in the same SRID.

If you feed in geometries with differing SRIDs you will just get an
error:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# %%sql

# SELECT ST_Equals(
#          ST_GeomFromText('POINT(0 0)', 4326),
#          ST_GeomFromText('POINT(0 0)', 26918)
#          )
```

Be careful of getting too happy with using
`ST_Transform` for on-the-fly
conversion. Spatial indexes are built using SRID of the stored
geometries. If comparison are done in a different SRID, spatial indexes
are (often) not used. It is best practice to choose **one SRID** for all
the tables in your database. Only use the transformation function when
you are reading or writing data to external applications.

## Transforming Data

If we return to our proj4 definition for SRID 26918, we can see that our
working projection is UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) of zone 18,
with meters as the unit of measurement.

    +proj=utm +zone=18 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs

Let\'s convert some data from our working projection to geographic
coordinates \-- also known as \"longitude/latitude\".

To convert data from one SRID to another, you must first verify that
your geometry has a valid SRID. Since we have already confirmed a valid
SRID, we next need the SRID of the projection to transform into. In
other words, what is the SRID of geographic coordinates?

The most common SRID for geographic coordinates is 4326, which
corresponds to \"longitude/latitude on the WGS84 spheroid\". You can see
the definition at the spatialreference.org site:

> <http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/>

You can also pull the definitions from the `spatial_ref_sys` table:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT srtext FROM spatial_ref_sys WHERE srid = 4326;
```

Let\'s convert the coordinates of the \'Broad St\' subway station into
geographics:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT ST_AsText(geom)
FROM nyc_subway_stations
WHERE name = 'Broad St';
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT ST_AsText(ST_Transform(geom,4326))
FROM nyc_subway_stations
WHERE name = 'Broad St';
```

If you load data or create a new geometry without specifying an SRID,
the SRID value will be 0. Recall in `geometries`, that when we created our `geometries` table we didn\'t
specify an SRID. If we query our database, we should expect all the
`nyc_` tables to have an SRID of 26918, while the `geometries` table
defaulted to an SRID of 0.

To view a table\'s SRID assignment, query the database\'s
`geometry_columns` table.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT f_table_name AS name, srid
FROM geometry_columns;
```

However, if you know what the SRID of the coordinates is supposed to be,
you can set it post-facto, using `ST_SetSRID` on the geometry. Then you will be able to transform the
geometry into other systems.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT ST_AsText(
 ST_Transform(
   ST_SetSRID(geom,26918),
 4326)
)
FROM geometries;
```
