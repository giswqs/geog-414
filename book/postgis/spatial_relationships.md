## Connecting to the database

```{code-cell} ipython3
%load_ext sql
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
host = "localhost"
database = "nyc"
user = os.getenv('SQL_USER')
password = os.getenv('SQL_PASSWORD')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
connection_string = f"postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{database}"
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%sql $connection_string
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT * from nyc_subway_stations LIMIT 5
```

## Spatial Relationships

So far we have only used spatial functions that measure (`ST_Area`,
`ST_Length`), serialize (`ST_GeomFromText`) or deserialize (`ST_AsGML`)
geometries. What these functions have in common is that they only work
on one geometry at a time.

Spatial databases are powerful because they not only store geometry,
they also have the ability to compare *relationships between
geometries*.

Questions like "Which are the closest bike racks to a park?" or "Where
are the intersections of subway lines and streets?" can only be answered
by comparing geometries representing the bike racks, streets, and subway
lines.

The OGC standard defines the following set of methods to compare
geometries.

## ST_Equals

`ST_Equals(geometry A, geometry B)`tests the spatial equality of two geometries.

![](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/_images/st_equals.png)

ST_Equals returns TRUE if two geometries of the same type have identical
x,y coordinate values, i.e. if the second shape is equal (identical) to
the first shape.

First, let\'s retrieve a representation of a point from our
`nyc_subway_stations` table. We\'ll take just the entry for \'Broad
St\'.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT name, geom, ST_AsText(geom)
FROM nyc_subway_stations
WHERE name = 'Broad St';
```

Then, plug the geometry representation back into an
`ST_Equals` test:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT name
FROM nyc_subway_stations
WHERE ST_Equals(geom, '0101000020266900000EEBD4CF27CF2141BC17D69516315141');
```

## ST_Intersects, ST_Disjoint, ST_Crosses and ST_Overlaps

`ST_Intersects`,
`ST_Crosses`, and
`ST_Overlaps` test whether the
interiors of the geometries intersect.

![](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/_images/st_intersects.png)

`ST_Intersects(geometry A, geometry B)` returns t (TRUE) if the two shapes have any space in
common, i.e., if their boundaries or interiors intersect.

![](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/_images/st_disjoint.png)

The opposite of ST_Intersects is
`ST_Disjoint(geometry A , geometry B)`. If two geometries are disjoint, they do not intersect,
and vice-versa. In fact, it is often more efficient to test \"not
intersects\" than to test \"disjoint\" because the intersects tests can
be spatially indexed, while the disjoint test cannot.

![](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/_images/st_crosses.png)

For multipoint/polygon, multipoint/linestring, linestring/linestring,
linestring/polygon, and linestring/multipolygon comparisons,
`ST_Crosses(geometry A, geometry B)`
returns t (TRUE) if the intersection results in a geometry whose
dimension is one less than the maximum dimension of the two source
geometries and the intersection set is interior to both source
geometries.

![](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/_images/st_overlaps.png)

`ST_Overlaps(geometry A, geometry B)`
compares two geometries of the same dimension and returns TRUE if their
intersection set results in a geometry different from both but of the
same dimension.

Let\'s take our Broad Street subway station and determine its
neighborhood using the `ST_Intersects`
function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT name, ST_AsText(geom)
FROM nyc_subway_stations
WHERE name = 'Broad St';
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT name, boroname
FROM nyc_neighborhoods
WHERE ST_Intersects(geom, ST_GeomFromText('POINT(583571 4506714)',26918));
```

## ST_Touches

`ST_Touches` tests whether two
geometries touch at their boundaries, but do not intersect in their
interiors

![](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/_images/st_touches.png)

`ST_Touches(geometry A, geometry B)`
returns TRUE if either of the geometries\' boundaries intersect or if
only one of the geometry\'s interiors intersects the other\'s boundary.

## ST_Within and ST_Contains

`ST_Within` and
`ST_Contains` test whether one
geometry is fully within the other.

![](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/_images/st_within.png)

`ST_Within(geometry A , geometry B)`
returns TRUE if the first geometry is completely within the second
geometry. ST_Within tests for the exact opposite result of ST_Contains.

`ST_Contains(geometry A, geometry B)`
returns TRUE if the second geometry is completely contained by the first
geometry.

## ST_Distance and ST_DWithin

An extremely common GIS question is \"find all the stuff within distance
X of this other stuff\".

The `ST_Distance(geometry A, geometry B)` calculates the *shortest* distance between two
geometries and returns it as a float. This is useful for actually
reporting back the distance between objects.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT ST_Distance(
  ST_GeometryFromText('POINT(0 5)'),
  ST_GeometryFromText('LINESTRING(-2 2, 2 2)'));
```

For testing whether two objects are within a distance of one another,
the `ST_DWithin` function provides an
index-accelerated true/false test. This is useful for questions like
\"how many trees are within a 500 meter buffer of the road?\". You
don\'t have to calculate an actual buffer, you just have to test the
distance relationship.

![](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/_images/st_dwithin.png)

Using our Broad Street subway station again, we can find the streets
nearby (within 10 meters of) the subway stop:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql

SELECT name
FROM nyc_streets
WHERE ST_DWithin(
        geom,
        ST_GeomFromText('POINT(583571 4506714)',26918),
        10
      );
```

And we can verify the answer on a map. The Broad St station is actually
at the intersection of Wall, Broad and Nassau Streets.
