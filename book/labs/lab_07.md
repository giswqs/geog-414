## Question 1

Create a fishnet with a 4-degree interval based on the extent of `[-112.5439, 34.0891, -85.0342, 49.6858]`. Use the fishnet to download the Landsat 7 image tiles by the fishnet using the `geemap.download_ee_image_tiles()` function. Relevant Earth Engine assets:

-   `ee.Image('LANDSAT/LE7_TOA_5YEAR/1999_2003')`

## Question 3

Create annual cloud-free Sentinel-2 imagery for the years 2017-2023 for a US county of your choice. Download the images to your computer. You can download a coarse resolution image to speed up the download process. Narrow down the date range (e.g., summer months) to reduce the number of images, which can avoid memory errors.
