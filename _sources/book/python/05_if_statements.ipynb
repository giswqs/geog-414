You’ll learn to write simple if statements, and you’ll learn how to create a more complex series of if statements to identify when the exact conditions you want are present. You’ll then apply this concept to lists, so you’ll be able to write a for loop that handles most items in a list one way but handles certain items with specific values in a different way.\n",

The following code loops through a list of car names and looks for the value 'bmw'. Whenever the value is 'bmw', it’s printed in uppercase instead of title case:"

    "In this chapter you learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to True or False. You learned to write simple if statements, if-else chains, and if-elif-else chains. You began using these structures to identify particular conditions you needed to test and to know when those conditions have been met in your programs. You learned to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a for loop. You also revisited Python’s style recommendations to ensure that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and understand."
