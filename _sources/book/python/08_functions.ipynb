When you want to perform a particular task that you’ve defined in a function, you call the function responsible for it. If you need to perform that task multiple times throughout your program, you don’t need to type all the code for the same task again and again; you just call the function dedicated to handling that task, and the call tells Python to run the code inside the function. You’ll find that using functions makes your programs easier to write, read, test, and fix.\n",

You learned how to use functions with lists, dictionaries, if statements, and while loops.\n",

    "Functions allow you to write code once and then reuse that code as many times as you want. When you need to run the code in a function, all you need to do is write a one-line call and the function does its job. When you need to modify a function’s behavior, you only have to modify one block of code, and your change takes effect everywhere you’ve made a call to that function.\n",

    "Functions also make your code easier to test and debug. When the bulk of your program’s work is done by a set of functions, each of which has a specific job, it’s much easier to test and maintain the code you’ve written. You can write a separate program that calls each function and tests whether each function works in all the situations it may encounter. When you do this, you can be confident that your functions will work properly each time you call them."
