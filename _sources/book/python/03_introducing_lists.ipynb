You can put anything you want into a list, and the items in your list don’t have to be related in any particular way. Because a list usually contains more than one element, it’s a good idea to make the name of your list plural, such as letters, digits, or names. In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas. Here’s a simple example of a list that contains a few kinds of bicycles:"
