    "\n",
    "When you’re using variables in Python, you need to adhere to a few rules and guidelines. Breaking some of these rules will cause errors; other guidelines just help you write code that’s easier to read and understand. Be sure to keep the following variable rules in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. For instance, you can call a variable `message_1` but not `1_message`.\n",
    "- Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, `greeting_message` works, but `greeting message` will cause errors.\n",
    "- Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular pro- grammatic purpose, such as the word print. (See [Python Keywords and Built-in Functions](http://bit.ly/2UjAebR))\n",
    "- Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, `name` is better than `n`, `student_name` is better than `s_n`, and `name_length` is better than `length_of_persons_name`.\n",
    "- Be careful when using the lowercase letter `l` and the uppercase letter `O` because they could be confused with the numbers `1` and `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get errors if you use uppercase letters, but uppercase letters in variable names have special meanings that we’ll discuss in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables\n",

    "Every programmer makes mistakes, and most make mistakes every day. Although good programmers might create errors, they also know how to respond to those errors efficiently. Let’s look at an error you’re likely to make early on and learn how to fix it. We’ll write some code that generates an error on purpose.

    "In this example, the variable name refers to the lowercase string \"ada lovelace\". The method title() appears after the variable in the print() call. A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work. That informa- tion is provided inside the parentheses. The title() function doesn’t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty. The title() method changes each word to title case, where each word begins with a capital letter. This is useful because you’ll often want to think of a name as a piece of information. For example, you might want your pro- gram to recognize the input values Ada, ADA, and ada as the same name, and display all of them as Ada. Several other useful methods are available for dealing with case as well. For example, you can change a string to all uppercase or all lowercase letters like this:"

    "### What Kind of Comments Should You Write?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed to do and how you are making it work. When you’re in the middle of working on a project, you understand how all of the pieces fit together. But when you return to a project after some time away, you’ll likely have forgotten some of the details. You can always study your code for a while and figure out how segments were supposed to work, but writing good comments can save you time by summarizing your overall approach in clear English. If you want to become a professional programmer or collaborate with other programmers, you should write meaningful comments. Today, most software is written collaboratively, whether by a group of employees at one company or a group of people working together on an open source project. Skilled programmers expect to see comments in code, so it’s best to start adding descriptive comments to your programs now. Writing clear, concise comments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as a new programmer."
