Also, we’d have to change our code each time the list’s length changed. A for loop avoids both of these issues by letting Python manage these issues internally.

In the previous examples, the lines that printed messages to individual magicians were part of the for loop because they were indented. Python’s use of indentation makes code very easy to read. Basically, it uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code with a clear visual structure. In longer Python programs, you’ll notice blocks of code indented at a few different levels. These indentation levels help you gain a general sense of the overall program’s organization.\n",

    "Lists work well for storing collections of items that can change throughout the life of a program. The ability to modify lists is particularly important when you’re working with a list of users on a website or a list of characters in a game. However, sometimes you’ll want to create a list of items that cannot change. Tuples allow you to do just that. Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an immutable list is called a tuple.\n",

Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by using each item’s index, just as you would for a list. For example, if we have a rectangle that should always be a certain size, we can ensure that its size doesn’t change by putting the dimensions into a tuple:"
